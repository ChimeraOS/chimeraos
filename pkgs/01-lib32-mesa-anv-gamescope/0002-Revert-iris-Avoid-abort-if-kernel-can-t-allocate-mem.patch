Subject: [PATCH] Revert "iris: Avoid abort() if kernel can't allocate memory"
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

This reverts commit f9d8d9acbb6a620684fb4dac4affe25816587d92.

Now ENOMEM is handled in submit_batch(), we don't need to check it for
resetting anymore.
