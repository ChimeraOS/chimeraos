The Mesa 3D Graphics Library

Disclaimer

   Mesa is a 3-D graphics library with an API which is very similar to
   that of [1]OpenGL.* To the extent that Mesa utilizes the OpenGL command
   syntax or state machine, it is being used with authorization from
   [2]Silicon Graphics, Inc.(SGI). However, the author does not possess an
   OpenGL license from SGI, and makes no claim that Mesa is in any way a
   compatible replacement for OpenGL or associated with SGI. Those who
   want a licensed implementation of OpenGL should contact a licensed
   vendor.

   Please do not refer to the library as MesaGL (for legal reasons). It's
   just Mesa or The Mesa 3-D graphics library.

   * OpenGL is a trademark of [3]Silicon Graphics Incorporated.

   The core Mesa library is licensed according to the terms of the MIT
