Subject: [PATCH] Revert "iris: Avoid abort() if kernel can't allocate memory"

This reverts commit f9d8d9acbb6a620684fb4dac4affe25816587d92.

Now ENOMEM is handled in submit_batch(), we don't need to check it for
resetting anymore.

(cherry picked from commit af935f451f7437ab86235903da8fefb71f0d4bb7)
