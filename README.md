Currently Project Amalgama, or AmalgamOS, is for my own personal use only.

In case you were curious about the name:

All of my projects have a "Project [Latin] name scheme. In this case, a chimera is also known as an amalgamation, derived from "amalgam," which is, in turn, derived from the Latin word "amalgama." Thus, Project Amalgama, or AmalgamOS, for short.
